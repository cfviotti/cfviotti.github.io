- **Led the Product Discovery and User Experience implementation** of a blog-like feature that dynamically generated **60k** content pages with structured data and a 100% Lighthouse SEO score, empowering Buser's organic traffic to move from **500k to 2.5M** in less than a **year**
- **Contributed to the User Experience implementation** of a single-page checkout without a sign-up requirement, driving up our conversion rate by **16%**
- **Led the implementation of a lean CSS-based Carousel component** for our Design System UI library, reducing its size by **30%** due to the removal of a large third-party library
- **Advocated and was responsible for thorough Pull Requests and Code Reviews**, effectively influencing other teams to follow the same practices that were previously absent
- **Contributed to building and supporting multiple components of our self-developed Design System UI library**, advocating for good documentation, unit testing with an accessibility-first approach, and clean code, delivering great DX for component consumption
- **Responsible for multiple critical tasks requiring end-to-end work at the Design-Implementation spectrum**, effectively delivering them with quick intuition, either with previous Figma prototypes or designing directly with code and later implementation
- **Advocated and was responsible for good CSS practices** throughout the whole organization, serving as a reference, mentor, and go-to guy for everything styling-related
- **Mentored interns** with coding classes, assigning them non-critical simple tasks, providing thorough code reviews, asynchronous support, and pair programming
