- **Led the product discovery, the Design Sprint facilitation, and implemented the user experience** for the reboot of Wikilegis, innovating how Brazilian law drafts can receive citizen opinions, have them judged in a Tinder-like fashion, while also empowering law-makers through a custom legislative text editor and consensus analysis of each opinion that has been judged by citizens.
- **Designed and implemented the user experience** for Audiencias Interativas, which enabled citizens to remotely have their questions crowd-ranked and answered in public hearings from the House of Representatives. Committees adopted the tool so much, that now around 55% of all hearings are available on it.
